Here are listed some of the errors you might encounter, as well as how they can be fixed. First, make sure that:

	- TORCS_BASE is set to the TORCS folder, example:
		export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.3.4

	- MAKE_DEFAULT is set as well, example:
		export MAKE_DEFAULT=$TORCS_BASE/Make-default.mk

	- LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains ${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib or /usr/local/lib/torcs, example:
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	

>> /usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.3.4/export/include/tgf.h:70:14: error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant

Solution: remove the definition of PI in SimpleDriver.h and wherever else it is present.


>> error while loading shared libraries: libtti.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Solution: while on the TTI folder
	$ make install 
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


>> fatal error: TTI.h: No such file or directory

Solution: while on the TTI folder
	$ make export


>> cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++11’

Solution: 
	change c++11 to c++0x in the makefile


If erros #2 or #3 persist, make sure your source compilation includes all necessary flags:
	-L${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib
	-I${TORCS_BASE}/export/include
	-ltti -ltgf -ltxml
