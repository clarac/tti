TTI is a tool developed to help the testing of TORCS drivers running in client-server mode. 
It is under development, currently only available for linux environments with limited testing done.

This library is intended for the necessary steps of performance evaluation during a process of developing
algorithms for drivers, or for modifying numeric settings in order to optimize their abilities. Because TORCS TUI is used,
and it was only introduced in v1.3.3, TTI is not compatible with earlier versions of the simulator.

Although a few limitations on the code for a driver are introduced, e.g. its performance should not depend on 
the client file, this library provides easy testing and comparing for a group of up to 10 drivers at once
in multiple, easily configured races. After testing is no longer needed, just making a substitution of 
the SimpleDriver for the new driver class along with any created additionally to the TORCS client code 
provided should make it run normally as well as it did during development.

Compilation will generate a shared object file and link it in ${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib.
The folder _test_ contains an example of how TTI can be used, more details can be found below.


Installation:

	copy the tti folder into ${TORCS_BASE}/src/ 
	$ cd ${TORCS_BASE}/src/tti
	$ make install
	$ make export
	
 

Example code:

	#include "tti.h"
	#include "SimpleDriver.cpp"

	int main(){
		  
		SimpleDriver *d = new SimpleDriver();
		std::vector<WrapperBaseDriver *> dv;
		
		dv.push_back(d);
	  
		tti t(dv);
		
		std::vector<raceData> rd = t.race();
		   
	}


	compile your code with flags
		-L${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib
		-I${TORCS_BASE}/export/include
		-ltti -ltgf -ltxml

	and include torcs/export/lib in your library path

	$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
