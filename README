TTI is a tool developed to help the testing of TORCS drivers running in client-server mode. 
It is under development, currently only available for Linux environments with limited testing done. TTI was created by Clara Caldeira (claramcaldeira@gmail.com) and is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL 2).

This library is intended for the necessary steps of performance evaluation during a process of developing algorithms for drivers, or for modifying numeric settings in order to optimize their abilities. Because TORCS's command line mode is used, and it was only introduced in v1.3.3, TTI is not compatible with earlier versions of the simulator.

*Important*
	A TORCS installation, its source folder and a SCR patch are required, see the competition manual (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1672.pdf) for details.

Installation:

	If you do not have your TORCS installation in the default path ("/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.3.4"),
	you must define the TORCS_BASE value with your custom setting:
	$ export TORCS_BASE=/absolute/path/to/torcs-1.3.4
		(where you unpacked torcs-1.3.4.tar.bz2 or later version)

	Similarly, the TORCS libraries are needed, so if you must include your path
	in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (nothing needs to be done if you have the default value 
	"/usr/local/lib/torcs/lib"):
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/absolute/path/to/torcs/lib
	

	Now your ready, go to TTI's main folder and run:
	$ make tti

	This should do everything automagically. To test if it works, run:
	$ make test
	
	Which will run a simple test, after a few seconds, the results of the race 
	should be displayed. The test is setup in file test/ttest.cpp, which can be 
	seen as a simple example of TTI usage (step-by-step instructions included).
