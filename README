TTI is a tool developed to help the testing of TORCS drivers running in client-server mode. 
It is under development, currently only available for linux environments with limited testing done. TTI was created by Clara Caldeira (claramcaldeira@gmail.com) and is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL 3).

This library is intended for the necessary steps of performance evaluation during a process of developing
algorithms for drivers, or for modifying numeric settings in order to optimize their abilities. Because TORCS's command line mode is used, and it was only introduced in v1.3.3, TTI is not compatible with earlier versions of the simulator.


Installation:

	copy the tti folder into ${TORCS_BASE}/src/ 
	$ cd ${TORCS_BASE}/src/tti
	$ make install
	$ make export


	compile your code with flags
		-L${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib
		-I${TORCS_BASE}/export/include
		-ltti -ltgf -ltxml

	and include torcs/export/lib in your library path

	$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${TORCS_BASE}/export/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
